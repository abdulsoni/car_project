                            <h2>Bad Credit? You Can Still Secure Car Financing with Quick Car Finance.</h2>
                            <p>If you’ve missed payments or struggled with debts in the past, you may have a bad credit score; and if you’re looking for car finance, you could well be
                              worrying about your chance of getting approved.</p>
                            <p>That’s where we step in.</p>
                            <h2>What is bad credit car finance?</h2>
                            <p>It’s not always easy to maintain a perfect credit score, - we get it. At Quick Car Finance, we make it our job to have car finance options available for customers with a range of credit histories, even if you have a bad credit score.</p>
                            <p>Our team works with a number of lenders that specialise in helping those with poor credit get car financing - so you could be driving away in a matter of days!</p>
                            <p>CCJs, mortgage arrears, and late payments don’t have to ruin your dream of buying a new vehicle. If you’ve been working with a debt management plan or IVA, we can help you, too. We offer a variety of solutions for aspiring vehicle owners with poor credit - so you’re guaranteed to find an option that suits you!</p>
                            <p>Even if someone else refused you, that doesn’t mean we can’t help. We commit to trying our best to find a car finance deal tailored to your needs.</p>
                            <p>Before assuming the worst, we recommend checking your credit report to ensure the information is accurate and up to date. One thing that is commonly classified as bad credit is having no credit at all. After all, with no borrowing history,  prospective lenders don’t have any information as to the likelihood of you repaying any finance or loan. That can often be classified as a risk.</p>
                            <p>We don’t judge you for financial mistakes you may have made in the past. We’re here to help you move forward and drive away in your next vehicle!</p>
                            <p>Our team has helped many customers in similar situations secure financing with bad credit, low credit, or even no credit!</p>
                            <h3>How QuickCarFinance can help</h3>
                            <p>QuickCarFinance will only match you with the most appropriate financing option for your unique situation. Even if you have bad credit, we look at the full picture. </p>
                            <p>By learning more about your history, we can match you with a financing option that would be most suitable to your lifestyle. We also take into account your preferred loan period and determine what range of monthly payments is in your budget. To make it even easier, we offer no deposit car finance options!</p>
                            <p>While we can’t guarantee financing approval, we try our hardest to find a car loan option that fits your needs.</p>
                            <p>Once we’ve located a financing option that suits you, we can provide a no-obligation quote for a loan. This offer will be tailored to your individual circumstances, and you’ll be supported by your very own personal advisor who’s on hand throughout the process to answer questions.</p>
                            <p>For your convenience, we’ve put togerher a handy car finance calculator tool for you to estimate your monthly payments and budget.</p>
                            <h3>What we need from you</h3>
                            <p>In order to review your credit history to provide a credit car loan, our lenders often ask for specific documents. The following documents are required to apply for a loan:</p>

                            <ol>
                                <li>Proof of licence</li>
                                <li>Proof of address</li>
                                <li>Proof of income</li>
                            </ol>

                            <p>For those of you who are self-employed, you may worry that the combination of this and having bad credit may disqualify you for car finance. This isn’t necessarily true, and we do have lenders that can help people that are self-employed with bad credit to get a car loan, subject to approval.</p>
                            <p>We help customers throughout the UK secure car financing, and if you have less than 3 years’ address history, we also have finance options available that may suit you.</p>
                            <p>Once you’re approved, it’s time for the fun bit! You can choose your vehicle from any of our reputable partner dealerships and we’ll give you access to our exclusive car search. This is there to help you to find your perfect! We also offer a range of additional financing options, including motorbike and van loans. </p>
                            <p>Applying for bad credit car finance takes a matter of minutes, and if approved, you could be driving away in days!
